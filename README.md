# Econometrics Final Project

This repository contains my final project for the ECON 6910 Applied Econometrics class. The aim of the project was to apply various econometrics tools to a real life scenerio and write a 6-10 page paper about it.
The code for the paper can be found in *EconResearch 2.ipynb*, the datasets can be found in *raw_data.csv* and *transformed_data.csv*, and finally my paper with the findings can be found in *Rabia_EconometricsFinal*.
